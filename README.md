# MissingNumber
An array A contains n−1 unique integers in the range [0, n−1], that is, there is one 
number from this range that is not in A. Write a program in Java to find that number. 
The complexity of your algorithm must be O(n). n and A are given. You are allowed to 
use only one additional integer variable (which is not an array). You may take the 
elements of array A from user
